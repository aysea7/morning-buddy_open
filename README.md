# Morning Buddy
A sketch for my custom morning alarm made out of a Wemos D1 mini (ESP8266) module and an encoder. A set of challenges must be completed with only one rotary encoder in order for the ESP8266 to send a message through a Telegram bot about the user being awake. If the user has not completed the challenges before the pre-set alarm time, a message will be sent to tell that the user is still asleep.
